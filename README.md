A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit with TailwindCSS, twin.macro, styled-components, Prettier, ESLint in

I created this project as a starter kit for my projects where I use the setup described above.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
